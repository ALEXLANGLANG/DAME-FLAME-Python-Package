## Vocabulary Guide

We briefly define some of the terms we use interchangeably throughout this User Guide and in this documentation below.

| Unit, Observation, Individual | A participant in the research trial, in either the control group or treatment group, for whom we have an observed outcome                     |
| Covariate, Observed data, X's, Independent variables  | The data we observe which is not the treatment group or the outcome      |
|  Outcome, Y, Dependent variables               | The outcome variable of the research |
| Treated Unit | A unit which is in the treatment group |
| Treatment Effects | We have a whole page on this. See [here](https://almost-matching-exactly.github.io/DAME-FLAME-Python-Package/documentation/user-guide/Treatment-Effects). |
| Matched group, matches | The group that a unit is assigned to based on the result of the matching algorithm |
| Main matched group | If units are assigned to multiple groups, each group has one group which is its main group, in which it is matched to units which it is most similar to. Other groups it is in will have less similar covariates  |
