## Standard Notation and Statistical Definitions

We say there are $i$ units or observations. These are the individuals being observed in the study. There are $n$ of them in total. 
We let $y_i$ be the outcome variable for each i. 
\(y_i\)
\begin{math}y_i\end{math}

.. math:: (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

$$ y_i $$

$$
e = mc^2
$$
