# Examples

To get started with one of our algorithms, click on a software package listed below for installation,
usage guides, and tutorials.

My thoughts....I should definitely do an example with fixed weights and with adaptive weights. And discuss the differences of the algorithm in both cases in the user guide. And also maybe do all of the options for the decision tree and logistic regression and stuff...and definitely discuss the difference between replace is true and replace is false.
